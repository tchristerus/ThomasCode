# ThomasCode
In order to learn the working of scripting languages and interpreters I decided to build it myself. Atleast giving it a try.

This language is only created for learning purposes and should not be used to build stuff.

## Some example pieces
Keep in mind that this is just some of my ideas thrown together in a codeblock :P
```python
print(20+33);
75+78/40;
print("hi");

class <ExampleClass> {
    <myMessage> = "hello";

    func showMessage(){
        print(<myMessage> + 3);
    }
}
```
